   Scholarship Participant, 01/2025 - 02/2025
    -   Offered a full scholarship to participate in a United Nations institute for Training and Research (UNITAR) certificate course focused on reproducible data analysis of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG’s).
    -   Using data collected on each of the Sustainable Development Goals through the Sustainable Development Report, our objective is to use Rstudio, the R coding language, to analyze the data from the report.
    -   At the end of the project, we will present our data analysis with visualizations created in R to display our findings and observations about the progress of a select few SDG’s and how we interpret our findings.
